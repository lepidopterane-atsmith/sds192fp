## An Introduction 
  New York City is the city that never sleeps. Since it is a big city, it is far from quiet. However, there is actually such a thing as being too loud in the Big Apple. Looking around for our project's focus, we found a lot of data associated with an insight competition with taxi data, including this set from NYC Open Data. We never attended loud parties that warrant police complaints, so we chose this topic to get to know who the noisemakers are. To help us understand these noisemakers, we folded in another dataset containing weather data from 2016. This gave us the unique perspective we needed to answer the question we had when looking at the initial dataset:
  **What can we learn from looking at a year of parties in NYC that were reported to the police for inordinate volume levels?**

## Of Parties and Perpetuators 
  The Leaflet map above is an interactive explorer of repeated noisemaking incidents. To refine this data, first we had to define a perpetuating circumstance. A perpetuator to us is a noisemaker who  was reported from the same location on at least two different days. Then we refined further, focusing on more heavy-duty perpetuators who had partied on at least 50 days so that rendering the sheer load of perpetuators would not slow down leaflet. 
  Perpetuators cluster around Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan, and most of them make noise in houses or other residential buildings. Looking at the average overall temperature of perpetuator reports, lower average temperatures averaged across reports for each perpetuator imply that perpetuators are more active during colder months. This trend towards more activity in lower average temperatures in the 30s and 40s is likely because some New Yorkers often leave the city during summertime, when more buildings in an area can increase the temperature.
